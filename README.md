###*A javascript based space physics simulation.*

Hello! This project aims to create a space physics simulation running in your browser.
More likely it will just cause some lags, but that's the best part of an alpha project, isn't it? 

# Controls
You can take off that red particle using ```[spacebar]```. Use the arrows to apply impulses and alter the particle trajectory.
```[W][A][S][D]``` keys will pan the camera, while the ```[mousewheel]``` will change the zoom.

# HELP!
In space, no one can hear you scream, but on GitHub someone might. If you are willing to help me with this project feel free to contact me or something. The oxygen level is getting low...
